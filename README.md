This package offers many simple random generators and utilities for game masters of fantasy role playing games inside a simple to use gui.

The package internals are really awful right now, but I am in the process of refactoring them so that it becomes more usable.



## Installation

```r
remotes::install_github("wrathematics/gmhelper")
```



## Usage

The package is basically useless without its shiny app. You can launch it by running:

```r
gmhelper::gmhelper()
```
