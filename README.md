This package offers many simple random generators and utilities for game
masters of fantasy role playing games. 

The package is far from ready for an official release, and all snapshots
should be considered highly experimental.


Assuming package installation is successful (see below), you can
start the gui from an R console via:

```r
gmhelper::gmhelper()
```


## Installation

Using the devtools package: 

```r
devtools::install_github("wrathematics/gmhelper")
```
