This package offers many simple random generators and utilities for game
masters of fantasy role playing games inside a simple to use gui.

Don't look too hard at the internals, because I wrote this labyrinthine
mess back when I didn't really understand R, and I never really refactored
it.  The package is far from ready for an official release, and all snapshots
should be considered highly experimental.




## Installation

```r
devtools::install_github("wrathematics/gmhelper")
```


## Usage

The package is basically useless without its shiny app.  You can
launch it by running:

```r
gmhelper::gmhelper()
```
