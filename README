This package offers many simple random generators and utilities for game
masters of fantasy role playing games. 

The package is far from ready for an official release, and all snapshots
should be considered highly experimental.

To install:
-Install R:  http://cran.r-project.org/
-Start R and enter the commands (without the leading minus):
  -install.packages("devtools")
  -install.packages(c("gWidgets", "gWidgetsRGtk2"))
  -install_github(repo="gmhelper", username="wrathematics")
-Don't be surprised if this does not work.
-If it miraculously does work, from R type the command gmhelper() from the
  R terminal to start the gui.
