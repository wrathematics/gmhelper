No copyright is asserted over these datasets.  This is for a
few reasons.  First, a lot of the data used here is taken from
long forgotten sources.  If I could credit them, I would, but
I honestly don't remember.  Second, a lot of the data just comes
straight out of Tolkien's works (name stems) or the AD&D books
(the items---which I collected from the net book of items).  Even 
though a great deal of work went into preparing these data sets, 
I can't really claim to own them, or that nobody owns them.  I'm
simply providing them "as-is".  

Of course, there is a great deal of original work in these 
datasets.  I don't have a problem with anyone taking these and
re-using them for something.  Just don't be an asshole and claim
to own them, because you obviously don't.

If you use anything here for commercial purposes, or claim to be
the copyright owner/creator and you get sued into infinity over it,
then don't come complaining to me.
