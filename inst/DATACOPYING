No copyright is asserted over these datasets.  This is for a
few reasons.  First, a lot of the data used here is taken from
long forgotten sources.  If I could credit them, I would, but
I honestly don't remember.  Second, a lot of the data is greatly
inspired by Tolkien's works (name stems) or the AD&D books
(the items---which I collected from the net book of items).  Even 
though a great deal of work went into preparing these data sets, 
I can't really claim to own them, or that nobody owns them.  I'm
simply providing them "as-is".

Of course, there is a great deal of original work in these 
datasets.  I don't have a problem with anyone taking these and
re-using them for something.  Just don't be an asshole and claim
to own them, because you obviously don't.  If you claim to be
the copyright owner/creator, Richard Stallman's beard will sue
you in internet court.  Using this work in a commercial source
is fine by me, but frankly I think you could do better.

If for some strange reason you need me to assert all of this in 
scary legalese, ask and I will do my best.
